                    This project involved using reinforcement learning to investigate the most efficient way of driving a swing.
                    My role in the simulation sub-group was to develop a physiologically accurate simulation of the stickman.
                    This involved developing methods to move the stickman using motors and ensure that the stickman's joints obeyed the same angular constraints as the human body to ensure realism.
                    I also worked with the machine learning team to ensure the simulation was ready for a genetic algorithm to be applied to it.
                    
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                    This project exposed me to developing simulations in pymunk, managing development in a team of 13 using GitHub, and reinforcement learning using a genetic algorithm.

                    The GIF above shows my simulation of a forest fire which was the subject of my final year physics coding project. 
                    The green squares represent trees, the black squares empty sites, and the orange squares burning trees. 
                    The Drossel and Schwabel model was used in this simulation which is an application of
                    site percolation theory. Site percolation theory has numerous important applications from computer networks to electrical conductivity. 
                    
                 </p>  
                 
                 <p>
                     Cluster labelling was implemented into the project as well (a cluster is a group of trees connected by their sides) via the Hosehen-Kopelman algorithm. 
                     This algorithm is an implementation of the union-find algorithm, which is important in Computer Science.
                 </p>
     
                 <p>
                     This project taught me a lot about algorithms and the importance of simulations and data analysis to solve problems which cannot be solved analytically.

                    Developed a QA Audit web-application to replace the previous system based mostly in Excel. Led the project through the full software development lifecycle and worked closely with the Audit team to ensure the application met their requirements. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    I also collaborated with another developer in DevOps to build a HR Audit system using the QA Audit system as a foundation. This project taught me a lot about collaboration as I had to work with people from different departments such as management, auditors, developers and bring their differing points of view together to ensure the QA Audit system met their needs.

                <p>
                    This resulted in a prototype application being developed that saved the auditors several hours a week as it automated the data collection and reports generation they previously had to do manually.

                For my physics degree year 2 lab project, we were tasked with calculating the speed of light in air. The basic idea was to move a transmitted laser various distances from a reference laser and measuring the resulting time difference between their peaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                Initially we only had values of the x and y positions of the transmitted and reference laser. We developed a python program to use data analysis (least squares fit, root finding) to calculate the speed of light in air from this data.
